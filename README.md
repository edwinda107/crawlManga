About it:
This project is for research purposes. FORBIDDING USING FOR BAD PURPOSES.

A few words from the developer:
First of all, I would like to apologize to the admins of blogtruyen,... for having taken the links in your host without permissions to test them, leading to the increase in the pageviews. Although the change is trivial, it still makes your web speed slower, so I am sincerely sorry about that.
My penultimate project about some unimportant stuffs uses Nodejs so if you are passing by, give me a star because that is a great source of motivation for those inexperienced developers like me. I will try my best to develop my last node project and other projects in the future.
